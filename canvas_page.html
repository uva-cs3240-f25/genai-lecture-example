<h2>CS 3240 — Responsible Use of GenAI in Coding</h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Explain why different GenAI models behave differently for coding.</li>
  <li>Choose appropriate interfaces (browser, API, IDE plug‑ins) for a task.</li>
  <li>Apply ethical considerations: licensing, attribution, privacy, security.</li>
  <li>Cite AI-assisted code clearly and professionally.</li>
  <li>Read and verify AI-generated code against stakeholder specs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In-Class Demo (Django)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Show the <em>AI first draft</em> of models/forms; ask students to spot what’s missing (ISBN, borrowing, validation).</li>
  <li>Switch to the <em>corrected</em> code. Run migrations and seed data. Borrow/return a book.</li>
  <li>Run tests: see weak test vs meaningful constraint test.</li>
  <li>Compare different tools on the “list users” view.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ethics & Citation</h3>
<pre><code># Generated with assistance from ChatGPT (Aug 2025). Adapted by &lt;Your Name&gt;.
# Changes: added ISBN validation, borrow model, permissions, pagination.

<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>
<p>
This week, use GenAI for a small coding task. Submit a 1‑page reflection: what it did well,
what you had to fix, and how you cited it.
